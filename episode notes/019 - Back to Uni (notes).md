(Sorry for the poor audio, we were trying something new with our mics and it didn't work that well)

Sam talks about starting her final semester studying Law, her experience being and assisting mature age students, the difficulties they face juggling study and other commitments, and challenges and pathways for mature age students to take up further studies.

We dive into doing assignments with references, the problems new students face getting up to speed with how to correctly format them, the [AGLC](http://law.unimelb.edu.au/mulr/aglc/about) legal citation guide and needing to submit documents in '.doc' format.

Other topics include [Sam](http://sand.fm/hosts/sam) taking up 'real' casual work, casual vs volunteer work, differences in our ages, [Dave](http://sand.fm/hosts/dave)s resemblance to [Ben Affleck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck), the Batman V Superman film, and a few other random snippets.
