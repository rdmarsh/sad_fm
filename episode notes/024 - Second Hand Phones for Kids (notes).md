Join Sam and Dave as they try and work out what phones to give their kids. Should they refurb the batteries in their old iPhone 4s or buy new phones for themselves and then hand down their iPhone 7 and iPhone SE? Sam also trys to work out which phone she prefers, but they don't seem to come to any conclusions.

Dave also completely forgot to check the [iPhone, iPad, Mac Buyer's Guide](https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/)
