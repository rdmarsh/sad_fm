Dave had a birthday that he's not interested in, but this prompts Sam to talk about her favourite thing in the world; food. Dave recounts having a meal he didn't want with a girl he was trying to impress, Sam talks about how they got engaged, which somehow spirals back to her favourite foods.

We also learn that Dave eats the same food nearly everyday, and had the foresight to purchase a backup emergency cake.
