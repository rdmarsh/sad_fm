SpaceX have launched a car into space and live streamed it to the world! Sam and Dave discuss the launch and other SpaceX stuff, most of which Dave gets wrong and proves you should do your research before talking. Sam discusses watching the launch live, and they both try and work out what's next for SpaceX and Humanity on Mars.

> SpaceX successfully launched the Falcon Heavy on February 6, 2018, at 3:45 p.m. EST (20:45 UTC). The dummy payload on its maiden flight was SpaceX founder Elon Musk's midnight cherry Tesla Roadster.

They also discuss Elon Musk's other ventures and projects he is involved with:

* [The Boring Company](https://www.boringcompany.com/faq/)
* [Hyperloop](http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop)

### Launched ###

`2018-Feb-06 20:45 UTC` by _Falcon Heavy (FH)_ from Kennedy Space Center, USA (launchpad 39A)

### Background ##

Dummy payload from the first launch of SpaceX Falcon Heavy launch vehicle. Consists of a standard Tesla Roadster automobile and a spacesuit-wearing mannequin nicknamed "Starman". 

Also includes a Hot Wheels toy model Roadster on the car's dash with a mini-Starman inside. A data storage device placed inside the car contains a copy of Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" novels. A plaque on the attachment fitting between the Falcon Heavy upper stage and the Tesla is etched with the names of more than 6,000 SpaceX employees.

After orbiting the Earth for 6 hours, a third-stage burn-to-depletion was completed at approximately 02:30 UTC Feb 7, placing the dummy payload in a heliocentric orbit having a perihelion of 0.99 AU and aphelion ~1.7 AU.

### Payload mass ##

~1250 Kg

## Mars info ##

* Distance from Sun: 1.52 AU
* Length of Day: 24.6 hours
* Length of Year: 1.88 years
* Gravity: about 38%

## Hornsdale Power Reserve ##

> On 14 December 2017, at 1.59am, the HPR reacted when unit A3 at Loy Yang Power Station tripped, releasing 560MW of base power, causing a dip in the system frequency from 50.0Hz to just under 49.8Hz. HPR released 7.3MW into the system and effectively stabilised the system before the Gladstone Power Station finally responded to underpin the load and system frequency. This Synchronverter reaction is a built in feature, but had not previously been effectively demonstrated.
