After a very long break and several interruptions, Sam and Dave finally find some time to record.

Prompted by a half remembered article about Australia becoming a cashless society, they talk about using ApplePay, the iPhone and Apple Watch. Sam talks about how people are still impressed when she uses her Apple Watch to pay for things and they both get distracted by doing real-time tech support for Sam and her iPhone.
