Sam and Dave talk about the NSW container deposit and recycling scheme called "Return and Earn", their visits to the 'reverse vending machine', and a quick tangent about milk crates and the legally dubious methods Dave was contemplating in an effort to acquire one.

## Reverse vending machines ##

From [returnandearn.org.au](http://returnandearn.org.au/) FAQ:

> A reverse vending machine is a machine where you can return empty eligible containers like bottles and cans for recycling. When you insert your empty containers into the chute at the front of the machine, it will scan your container to ensure it is eligible for a refund. When youâ€™ve finished depositing the containers, choose your preferred refund option on the electronic screen.

> The machine will have options for either:

> * A voucher redeemable in NSW Woolworths Supermarkets
> * Electronic financial redemption
> * Charity donation

### Glass ###

The glass needs to be put into it's own machine separate from the other items:

### Cartons, plastics and cans ###

This interface shows info about quantity returned, has a barcode scanner and prints a voucher:

## Milk crates ###

Dave found some milk crates that were put out for hard rubbish pickup. They make sorting easier. We can fit 42 cans in each milk crate without squashing them, have handles so kids can carry easily, and can stack in the back of the car without tipping cans out everywhere:
