[Sam](/hosts/sam) and [Dave](/hosts/dave), a married couple with two boys, have a quick chat about things they find interesting, tech news or politics, or other events that happen in their lives.

Are their rambunctious boys ([Josh](/guests/josh) and [Simon](/guests/simon) mucking up again? Is [Max the dog](/guests/max) making a mess? Has Dave bought another gadget, does he think he's found some interesting tech or political news, or come up with another crazy theory? Will Sam ever talk sense into him? Are they going to have a fight, or is it just a nice chat today?
