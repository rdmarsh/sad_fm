Sam and Dave have a quick chat. Are the kids mucking up again? Has Dave bought another gadget, thinks he's found some interesting tech or political news, or come up with another crazy theory? Will Sam ever talk sense into him? Are they going to have a fight, or is it just a nice chat from the couch?
