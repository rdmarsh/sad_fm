Dave co-hosts the [sand.fm](http://sand.fm/) podcast with his wife [Sam](/hosts/sam).

Dave has two active boys. He is an indoor enthusiast, enjoying spending many hours in the wild indoors basking in the cool glow of a laptop screen. 

He tends to find the most difficult way to achieve anything, and after managing to do things the hard way is often surprised when things don't work.
