## Information about copyrights ##

For Australians: TL;DR: I'm not a lawer so this is just my understanding and do your own research. I think if you want to just use some music (eg less that 40%), you can licence it for $275 per year for podcasts with fewer than 110,000 downloads per year. Again, I'm not sure so please check.

ONLINE MINI-LICENCE (This low-cost licence covers online services with low levels of music use earning less than $12,000 a year) (Licence fees start at $275.00 per year (includes 10% GST)):

Note: The Online Mini Licence does not include corporate campaigns (unless using production music), synchronisations, theme songs or semi interactive and interactive streaming services.
